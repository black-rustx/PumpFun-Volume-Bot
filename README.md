## üéÆ **Modes of Operation**

The bot offers several modes for different use cases, each designed for specific tasks like generating volume, trading, and wallet management.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Buy Modes**

1. **Gen Volume (JITO)**

   - **How it works**: Bundles up to 10 wallets to buy a token until all wallets have participated.
   - **When to use**: When you need to generate volume for a token.

2. **Auto Volume (JITO)**

   - **How it works**: Monitors the dev address for new Pump.Fun launches and automatically runs human-like trades to generate volume.
   - **When to use**: Ideal for automatic token volume generation after new token launches.

3. **Human Mode (JITO)**

   - **How it works**: Executes the ‚ÄúBuy Buy Sell‚Äù strategy across all wallets to simulate human trading behavior.
   - **When to use**: When you want to simulate realistic trades with each wallet.

4. **MicroBuy (SPAM)**

   - **How it works**: Continuously buys small amounts of a token using the configuration values, without using JITO.
   - **When to use**: Ideal for generating micro volume and spamming buys.

5. **Same TX**

   - **How it works**: Spams buy & sell transactions with the same wallet in a loop.
   - **When to use**: Useful for constant trading activity with a fixed amount.

6. **Warmup Mode**

   - **How it works**: Buys and sells recently traded tokens with a random SOL amount to avoid detection as a new wallet.
   - **When to use**: To simulate activity from fresh wallets, avoiding blockchain scanners.

7. **Stagger Mode**
   - **How it works**: Delays each buy with a defined time interval and uses JITO for optimized transactions.
   - **When to use**: For staggered volume generation with precise delays between buys.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Sell Modes**

1. **Sell All (JITO)**

   - **How it works**: Sells all tokens in each wallet.
   - **When to use**: To sell the entire token balance across all wallets.

2. **Single Sell**

   - **How it works**: Sells 100% of the tokens from a selected wallet.
   - **When to use**: When you want to sell tokens from a specific wallet.

3. **Cleanup Mode**
   - **How it works**: Sells all tokens in your wallets, essentially cleaning up all your Pump.Fun tokens.
   - **When to use**: After finishing your trading activity, to clean up your wallets.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Wallet Modes**

1. **Gen Wallets**

   - **How it works**: Generates a specified number of wallets and stores them in `/keypairs` along with `wallets.txt`.
   - **When to use**: To generate multiple wallets for volume generation.

2. **Check Balances**

   - **How it works**: Checks the SOL and SPL token balance of each wallet.
   - **When to use**: To monitor wallet balances.

3. **Close Token Accounts**

   - **How it works**: Closes unused SPL Token Accounts to reclaim rent fees.
   - **When to use**: To clean up unnecessary token accounts.

4. **Create Profiles**
   - **How it works**: Creates profiles (username + bio) on Pump.Fun.
   - **When to use**: When you want to create profiles for your wallets.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Transfer Modes**

1. **Transfer SOL to Sub Wallets**

   - **How it works**: Transfers SOL from your main wallet to every sub-wallet in `wallets.txt` or `/keypairs`.
   - **When to use**: To fund your sub-wallets for transaction fees.

2. **Transfer SOL Back to Main Wallet**

   - **How it works**: Sends SOL from each sub-wallet back to your main wallet.
   - **When to use**: To consolidate SOL back to the main wallet.

3. **Transfer Tokens to Wallet**

   - **How it works**: Transfers 100% of the token balance from your sub-wallets to a specified wallet.
